# cpp-coq-ffi

A primitive set data structure for Coq, using `std::set` from C++.

This is only meant to be an experiment. The example returns the right result but it has other bugs about memory management.

You can compile it by `make`, and then run `./prog`.

This compiles for me with this commit of CertiCoq: https://github.com/CertiCoq/certicoq/commit/706ef73cf8ca9b3d41e046b0bf35e28083cfeac0
